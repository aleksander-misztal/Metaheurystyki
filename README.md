# Subset-sum Problem

The SUBSET-SUM problem involves determining whether or not a subset from a list of integers can sum to a target value. 

For example, consider the list of `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`. 

If the `target = 7`, there are two subsets that achieve this `sum: {3, 4}` and `{1, 2, 4}`. If `target = 11`, there are no solutions.
